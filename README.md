Batch imports for DSpace use the Simple Archive Format (SAF). This code is used to create SAF import directories from a csv file.

The program input is a subdirectory that contains the csv file and bitstreams. The output are SAF subdirectories that contain dublin core metadata,
a contents file listing bitstreams and bitstream metadata, and optional iiif and local metadata files.
